Elemental File Sync v0.3.1
Just like Git, but without version control.

You shouldn't use this command.
Use `<python> -m filesync.<someModule> [someArgument]` instead.
There's the module list:
    - client
        Runs the client mode of EFS to clone files from server. See GitHub Wiki for more information.
    - server
        Runs the server mode of EFS to generate index file. See GitHub Wiki for more information.
